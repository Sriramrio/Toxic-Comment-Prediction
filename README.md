# 🛡️ Toxic Comment Prediction

## 📌 Overview
**Toxic Comment Prediction** is a machine learning project that automatically detects and classifies toxic comments in online platforms.  
It helps moderate content by identifying abusive, threatening, or harmful language to ensure a safe and respectful online environment.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Online platforms face a major challenge in moderating **harmful and offensive comments**.  
Manual moderation is:
- Time-consuming
- Prone to human bias
- Difficult to scale for large volumes of user-generated content

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Our system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to:
- Preprocess and clean comment text
- Extract meaningful features
- Classify comments into toxic and non-toxic categories
- Support multiple subcategories like *threats, insults, hate speech, and harassment*

---

## 🚀 Key Features
✅ Real-time detection of toxic comments  
✅ Multi-label classification (toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate)  
✅ Clean and preprocess raw text data automatically  
✅ Trained on large-scale datasets for higher accuracy  
✅ Can be integrated with websites, forums, and chat systems

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### **Languages & Frameworks**
- Python 3.9
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLTK / spaCy

### **Dataset**
- Kaggle’s *Toxic Comment Classification Challenge* dataset

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Gather toxic and non-toxic comment data  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Remove punctuation, stopwords, lowercase text, lemmatization  
3. **Feature Extraction** – TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or word embeddings  
4. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
6. **Deployment** – Integrate with a web app or moderation system

## 📊 Example Model Performance
| Model                | Accuracy | F1-Score |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 91%      | 0.89     |
| LSTM (Deep Learning) | 94%      | 0.92     |
